Hey! My name is Nitish Krishna and this is my personal blog.

I work at [Cruise](https://getcruise.com), the self-driving car company as a Senior Software Engineer.

In my free time I love going on hikes with my wife Gabby and reading fiction and non-fiction while our two cats Yuri and Renzo sleep nearby.
